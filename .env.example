# ===================================================================
# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration (Optional)
# ===================================================================
# Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to expose your app publicly without
# opening ports on your server. It creates a secure outbound connection
# to Cloudflare's network.
#
# HOW TO SETUP:
# 1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/zero-trust
# 2. Navigate to: Zero Trust > Networks > Tunnels
# 3. Click "Create a tunnel" and choose "Cloudflared"
# 4. Choose your platform (Docker/Linux/macOS/Windows)
# 5. Copy the tunnel token provided
#
# USAGE:
# - Set this variable to enable Cloudflare Tunnel in Docker Compose
# - Leave empty to run without Cloudflare Tunnel (local only)
#
# CONFIGURE YOUR DOMAIN:
# After creating the tunnel, configure a Public Hostname:
# - Subdomain: polls (or your preferred subdomain)
# - Domain: yourdomain.com
# - Service: http://app:3000 (Docker internal service name)
#
# Your app will then be accessible at: https://polls.yourdomain.com
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit your actual .env file to version control
# - Keep your tunnel token secret
# - The tunnel creates an outbound connection only (no open ports needed)
